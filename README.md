# ScrapeAnime

ScrapeAnime is a Python script that allows anyone to download a whole show from the website 'ww1.JustDubs.tv'. There is little room to contrive and make imporvized scripts, however 'dataScrapeFunctions.py' contains 4 functions that could be useful.

## Installation
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/silthecodeman/ScrapeAnime.git"
cd scrapeAnime
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
When runing the program, the comand line will prompt the user to enter a url. 
```bash

```
This url is specific to 'ww1.JustDubs.tv' and will only work if it is a url that leads to the home page of the intended anime. The page in question should also contin a list of the anime's episodes as well as general information. Go to https://ww1.justdubs.tv/anime/1565-akame-ga-kill-english-dub for an example of what the url should look like.

Next, the comand prompt will ask if there is any more shows you wish to download.
```bash

```

The program will then orginize the anime and it's episodes into a folder named 'Animes'.
