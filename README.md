# ScrapeAnime

ScrapeAnime is a Python script that allows anyone to download a whole show from the website 'ww1.JustDubs.tv'. There is little room to contrive and make imporvized scripts, however 'dataScrapeFunctions.py' contains 4 functions that could be useful.

## Installation
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/silthecodeman/ScrapeAnime.git"
cd scrapeAnime
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Prerequisites and Other Information
GNU Wget must be installed for the script to work. 
For macOS:
```bash 
brew install wget
```
For Linux:
```bash
sudo apt-get install wget
```
Google Chrome must be installed as well as ChromeDriver. ChromeDriver must be in the directory '/Users/username/Documents/geckodrivermac/' on macOS, if on Linux or any other operating system, one can select their own directory on line 19 of 'main.py' under the variable 'driverPath'. Both Google Chrome and ChromeDriver can be downloaded on https://www.google.com/chrome/ and https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. This program has only been tested on macOS Big Sur version 11.3.1 and is expected to work the same on Linux. This program has only been tested with Python 3.9.5 and will most likely work with Python 3.7 and up. Only Google Chrome version 90.0.4430.212 and ChromeDriver version 90.0.4430.24.

## How to Use
To initially run the program, the file 'main.py' needs to be run in the terminal.
```bash
python3 main.py
```
When runing the program, the comand line will prompt the user to enter a url. 
```bash
Anime URL >> 
```
This url is specific to 'ww1.JustDubs.tv' and will only work if it is a url that leads to the home page of the intended anime. The page in question should also contin a list of the anime's episodes as well as general information. Go to https://ww1.justdubs.tv/anime/3106-hack-quantum-english-dub for an example of what the url should look like.

Next, the comand prompt will ask if there is any more shows you wish to download.
```bash
Are there any more show urls? [Y/n] 
```

If there is, the program will ask for another url and the process will be repeated until there are no more urls to be scraped.
The program will then run and orginize the anime and it's episodes into a folder named 'Animes'.

As a rule of thumb, don't be discuraged if the program takes a while to run as there are several variables that could be the cause for the time delay including file size or internet connection.

## Issues
There are no issues execpt for the fact that some anime are stored in different databases and thus when the program attemmpts to use the command 'wget' it fails. However during the creation of this project, there was but one instnace of this occuring and refusing to download.
